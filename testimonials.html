                    Working with Farid, Bhavnesh, and the FB Celebrations Team was the best decision ever to create my dream wedding. After seeing the incredible work they did for our family member’s wedding, we didn’t have to think twice in choosing them for ours. After our first meeting together, we knew we were in great hands; that we could trust them. Bhavnesh creates possibilities out of nothing, while Farid curates the most unbelievable designs! Their passion is evident through their devotion to the perfect event flow. Their team is filled with the most hospitable people, who made sure we felt like the most special bride and groom in the world. From the start to the end, they patiently took heed of every single detail we wanted. We’re so grateful to them for making our special day unforgettable. Lots of love to the entire team!

                    I think I can speak on behalf of everyone from the Verma and Jain family. We are all so grateful and happy that we decided to work with FB Celebrations. Our wedding was so beautifully curated, well organised and warmly managed that we were able to enjoy so many moments with each other instead of worrying about the minor details. We have received so many compliments which are due to you guys and your friendly yet hard working team. Once again, thank you so much for your hard work and patience. I know we were one of your most demanding clients but I’m glad that we were able to get this done so well

                    "We want to have this wedding, for us, the bride and groom, to have the best time" - Us "That’s why we do what we do" - FB.  That was the short, yet precise conversation that Renu &amp; I had with Bhavnesh and Farid before we started the planning of our wedding. To enable all our ideas to fruition, Farid and Bhavnesh are backed with a very strong team who’ve worked with ace artists of a diverse range, super complicated logistics and substantial guest lists. This is what makes everything fun for us. <br>We had our wedding in the middle of the ocean in Maldives in a brand-new hotel, which we wanted to book entirely for us. FB Celebrations has handheld the senior management and core teams to learn and execute the mandatory elements an Indian wedding entails. This was a mammoth, complicated and tedious task. After months of planning each event tediously- one night before the events started, we were hit with a raging cyclone in the Maldives. This was the most crucial point where excellence and experience got its stage to shine. What we achieved from here on, was an incredible feat. <br>FB Celebrations worked brilliantly in tandem with the entire team to change venues, reproach key decisions and finally enable everything we dreamed of and beyond. It was a magical three days of eternal memories that were created. Only a rock-solid and phenomenal behind the scenes team can enable something of that magnitude. Raising the bar of celebrating love to cosmic heights! Here’s a toast to the best in the business.

                  "Have you ever had the feeling when you meet someone and you just know they are the one? Well that’s what happened with FB Celebrations. We have lost count on the number of planners we met before we met Bhavnesh.<br> And when we did , we had this feeling , we just knew we could trust him with our big day. And the fact that by the time we met then the day was just two weeks away, Bhavnesh and his team had a lot on their plate.<br>
                  Since there was no time to waste they straight away got to work. Reached Patiala and we went on a recce of the locations together. They asked for a theme, colour, look and feel and presented us with ideas which resonated with our thoughts beautifully.<br>
                  When it came to the wedding they were so hands on with everything that we didn't have to worry about the last minute work. The delivery, decoration and organisation was impeccable. They were constantly available and calm during the inevitable stress of wedding functions which lasted for four days. <br>We did not worry once on the day of our wedding, because we knew they were on top of everything. As important as this day was for us, they honoured that and made it even more memorable for us. <br>
                  Thank you FB Celebrations for your incredible teamwork and a special thank you to Bhavnesh, Rhea and Siya for their expertise, kindness, and attention to detail that allowed us to truly enjoy our wedding day to the fullest!<br>
                  We are eternally grateful to have FB Celebrations as our wedding planners and thank you for everything that you have done."

                    "Dear FB Celebrations Team,<br>
                    Thank you so much for all your hard work and sleepless nights to ensure each of our guests were personally taken care of by your team. Each member of your team was always available for every meeting and discussion and played a key role in making the event a success. It was a great experience to work with such a highly professional team who always had a smile on their face no matter what the situation was. The planning of the complete RSVP, coordinating the travel plans, rooming sheet as well as the execution was seamless.<br>
                    The comfort and ease that the team exhibits while handling the top stars of the country surely comes from many years of expertise in the area of entertainment and artist management.<br>
                   Kudos to Farid, Bhavnesh and the entire team for pulling off this magnitude of an event in a matter of 2 weeks!"
